Once a girl from Japan who lived with her parents visited an abandoned amusement park.
The girl was frightend of old stuff and weird environment of that amusement park but her 
parents was excited about the foods inside the amusement park but they did't know those foods 
were for ghost which may turn them into pigs if they ate them. Without knowing the fact her 
parents ate all of the foods there while she found out the amusement park is full of spireted stuff.
But it was too late for her to find out as her parents already turned into pigs and she got trapped 
inside the amusement park by the nightfall.
